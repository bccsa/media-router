# SoundProcessor
PCM Sound Processor

## EQ Settings (Live Updates)
* 10 band Eq

## Audio Dynamic (Live Updates)
* Knee: Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly
* Ratio: Set a ratio about which the signal is reduced. 1:2 means that if the level rises 4dB above the threshold, it will be only 2dB above after the reduction.
* Threshold: If a signal rises above this level it will affect the gain reduction
* Attack: Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain reduction starts
* Release: Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before the reduction is decreased again
* Makeup: Amplify your signal after processing

## Delay (Need to reload module to update)
* Set delay in Milliseconds
